# Accessible EdTech Platform

## üß† Project Overview
Accessible EdTech is a Django-based web application designed to enhance accessibility in educational environments. It provides tools for converting text to speech, transcribing speech in real time, formatting documents for dyslexia, and generating ASL (American Sign Language) video sequences from text. The platform integrates natural language processing and media processing libraries to support diverse learning needs.

## üöÄ Features
- **Text-to-Speech Conversion**  
  Upload .txt, .pdf, or .docx files and convert the text into spoken audio using Google Text-to-Speech (gTTS).

- **Real-Time Transcription**  
  Transcribe spoken input live using browser-based speech recognition or server-side Whisper models.

- **Dyslexia-Friendly Formatting**  
  Reformat uploaded documents with styles optimized for dyslexic readers.

- **Text-to-ASL Video Generation**  
  Convert text into a sequence of ASL video clips using MoviePy and a preloaded video asset library.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Setup Instructions
1. **Clone the Repository**
2. **Create a Virtual Environment**
3. **Install Dependencies**
4. **Apply Migrations**
5. **Run the Server**

## üß™ Usage
1. Navigate to the homepage.
2. Use the sidebar to access each feature:
   - **Text-to-Speech**: Upload a document and listen to the generated audio.
   - **Real-Time Transcription**: Click start and begin speaking.
   - **Dyslexia Formatting**: Upload a document and view the reformatted output.
   - **ASL Converter**: Input text and generate an ASL video sequence.

## üì¶ Dependencies
Key libraries used in this project include:
- Django, channels, daphne
- gTTS, faster-whisper, ctranslate2
- moviepy, imageio, pygame
- nltk, PyPDF2, pdfplumber, docx
- soundfile, numpy, requests

## Bugs / Things to Note
1. Our team mate, Ng Si Han (DevPost user: ngsihan), did not manage to join our DevPost team in time as he is doing reservist right now.
2. There might be a macOS error for our text-to-ASL feature (if you are using macOS). It triggers MoviePy to open a preview window or interact with the system GUI, especially on macOS. This can cause the error: NSInternalInconsistencyException: setting the main menu on a non-main thread because MoviePy (via imageio or pygame) tries to access macOS GUI APIs from a background thread, which is not allowed.
3. Download dependencies from 'requirements.txt' and 'requirements2.txt' should suffice
